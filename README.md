## ActiveMQ Request-Response Flow

This diagram illustrates the flow of sending and receiving messages in the system using ActiveMQ:

1. **Client Request**  
   The client sends a message request via the REST controller.

2. **Controller Sends Message**  
   The controller generates a unique `correlationId` and sends the message to the `sendMessage.queue` in ActiveMQ.

3. **Message Consumption**  
   A consumer listens to `sendMessage.queue`, processes the message, and forwards it to ActiveMQ for further handling.

4. **Correlation ID Tracking**  
   The `correlationId` generated by the controller is attached to the message to track the request-response lifecycle.

5. **Response Queue**  
   After processing, the message is sent to the response queue in ActiveMQ using the same `correlationId`.

6. **Controller Receives Response**  
   The system receives the response from ActiveMQ, matches it with the original `correlationId`, and returns the response to the client.

This flow ensures reliable asynchronous messaging while maintaining request-response tracking.
